# netdefs-rs

netdefs-rs is a library that provides definitions and structures for common networking
protocols and formats (e.g. IPv4, IPv6, MAC addresses, etc). It also provides lookup
capabilites for identifying these protocols from the raw data from a packet header
(e.g. EtherType, IPv4 Protocol field).
